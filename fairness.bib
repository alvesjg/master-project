  abstract = {The problem of clustering a set of points so as to minimize the maximum intercluster distance is studied. An O(kn) approximation algorithm, where n is the number of points and k is the number of clusters, that guarantees solutions with an objective function value within two times the optimal solution value is presented. This approximation algorithm succeeds as long as the set of points satisfies the triangular inequality. We also show that our approximation algorithm is best possible, with respect to the approximation bound, if P ≠ NP.}

  abstract = {We present a simple and natural greedy algorithm for the metric uncapacitated facility location problem achieving an approximation guarantee of 1.61. We use this algorithm to find better approximation algorithms for the capacitated facility location problem with soft capacities and for a common generalization of the k-median and facility location problems. We also prove a lower bound of 1+2/e on the approximability of the k-median problem. At the end, we present a discussion about the techniques we have used in the analysis of our algorithm, including a computer-aided method for proving bounds on the approximation factor.},

  abstract = {What does it mean for an algorithm to be biased? In U.S. law, unintentional bias is encoded via disparate impact, which occurs when a selection process has widely different outcomes for different groups, even as it appears to be neutral. This legal determination hinges on a definition of a protected class (ethnicity, gender) and an explicit description of the process.When computers are involved, determining disparate impact (and hence bias) is harder. It might not be possible to disclose the process. In addition, even if the process is open, it might be hard to elucidate in a legal setting how the algorithm makes its decisions. Instead of requiring access to the process, we propose making inferences based on the data it uses.We present four contributions. First, we link disparate impact to a measure of classification accuracy that while known, has received relatively little attention. Second, we propose a test for disparate impact based on how well the protected class can be predicted from the other attributes. Third, we describe methods by which data might be made unbiased. Finally, we present empirical evidence supporting the effectiveness of our test for disparate impact and our approach for both masking bias and preserving relevant information in the data. Interestingly, our approach resembles some actual selection practices that have recently received legal scrutiny.},

  abstract = { We present a novel approximation algorithm for \$k\$-median that achieves an approximation guarantee of \$1+\sqrt{3}+\epsilon\$, improving upon the decade-old ratio of \$3+\epsilon\$. Our improved approximation ratio is achieved by exploiting the power of pseudo-approximation. More specifically, our approach is based on two components, each of which, we believe, is of independent interest. First, we show that in order to give an \$\alpha\$-approximation algorithm for \$k\$-median, it is sufficient to give a pseudo-approximation algorithm that finds an \$\alpha\$-approximate solution by opening \$k+O(1)\$ facilities. This is a rather surprising result as there exist instances for which opening \$k+1\$ facilities may lead to a significantly smaller cost than that of opening only \$k\$ facilities. Second, we give such a pseudo-approximation algorithm with \$\alpha=1+\sqrt{3}+\epsilon\$. Prior to our work, it was not even known whether opening \$k+o(k)\$ facilities would help improve the approximation ratio. }
