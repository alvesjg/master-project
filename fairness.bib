abstract = {The problem of clustering a set of points so as to minimize the maximum intercluster distance is studied. An O(kn) approximation algorithm, where n is the number of points and k is the number of clusters, that guarantees solutions with an objective function value within two times the optimal solution value is presented. This approximation algorithm succeeds as long as the set of points satisfies the triangular inequality. We also show that our approximation algorithm is best possible, with respect to the approximation bound, if P ≠ NP.}

abstract = {Dependent rounding is a useful technique for optimization problems with hard budget constraints. This framework naturally leads to negative correlation properties. However, what if an application naturally calls for dependent rounding on the one hand and desires positive correlation on the other? More generally, we develop algorithms that guarantee the known properties of dependent rounding but also have nearly bestpossible behavior—near-independence, which generalizes positive correlation—on “small” subsets of the variables. The recent breakthrough of Li and Svensson for the classical k-median problem has to handle positive correlation in certain dependent rounding settings, and does so implicitly. We improve upon Li-Svensson’s approximation ratio for k-median from 2.732 + ϵ to 2.675 + ϵ by developing an algorithm that improves upon various aspects of their work. Our dependent rounding approach helps us improve the dependence of the runtime on the parameter ϵ from Li-Svensson’s NO(1/ϵ2) to NO((1/ϵ)log(1/ϵ)).},

Byrka proposed an algorithm parametrized by γ and used it with γ≈1.6774. By either running his algorithm or the algorithm proposed by Jain, Mahdian and Saberi (STOCʼ02), Byrka obtained an algorithm that gives expected approximation ratio 1.5. We show that if γ is randomly selected, the approximation ratio can be improved to 1.488. Our algorithm cuts the gap with the 1.463 approximability lower bound by almost 1/3.}

abstract = {A fundamental facility location problem is to choose the location of facilities, such as industrial plants and warehouses, to minimize the cost of satisfying the demand for some commodity. There are associated costs for locating the facilities, as well as transportation costs for distributing the commodities. We assume that the transportation costs form a metric. This problem is commonly referred to as theuncapacitated facility locationproblem. Application to bank account location and clustering, as well as many related pieces of work, are discussed by Cornuejols, Nemhauser, and Wolsey. Recently, the first constant factor approximation algorithm for this problem was obtained by Shmoys, Tardos, and Aardal. We show that a simple greedy heuristic combined with the algorithm by Shmoys, Tardos, and Aardal, can be used to obtain an approximation guarantee of 2.408. We discuss a few variants of the problem, demonstrating better approximation factors for restricted versions of the problem. We also show that the problem is max SNP-hard. However, the inapproximability constants derived from the max SNP hardness are very close to one. By relating this problem to Set Cover, we prove a lower bound of 1.463 on the best possible approximation ratio, assumingNP∉DTIME[nO(loglogn)].}

abstract = {What does it mean for an algorithm to be biased? In U.S. law, unintentional bias is encoded via disparate impact, which occurs when a selection process has widely different outcomes for different groups, even as it appears to be neutral. This legal determination hinges on a definition of a protected class (ethnicity, gender) and an explicit description of the process.When computers are involved, determining disparate impact (and hence bias) is harder. It might not be possible to disclose the process. In addition, even if the process is open, it might be hard to elucidate in a legal setting how the algorithm makes its decisions. Instead of requiring access to the process, we propose making inferences based on the data it uses.We present four contributions. First, we link disparate impact to a measure of classification accuracy that while known, has received relatively little attention. Second, we propose a test for disparate impact based on how well the protected class can be predicted from the other attributes. Third, we describe methods by which data might be made unbiased. Finally, we present empirical evidence supporting the effectiveness of our test for disparate impact and our approach for both masking bias and preserving relevant information in the data. Interestingly, our approach resembles some actual selection practices that have recently received legal scrutiny.},

abstract = {The fair k-median problem is one of the important clustering problems. The current best approximation ratio is 4.675 for this problem with 1-fairness violation, which was proposed by Bercea et al. [APPROX-RANDOM'2019]. To our best knowledge, there is no available approximation algorithm for this problem without any fairness violation in doubling metrics. In this paper, we consider the fair k-median problem in doubling metrics and general metrics. We provide the first QPTAS for the fair k-median problem based on the hierarchical decomposition and dynamic programming process in doubling metrics. For applying a dynamic programming process to solve this problem, the distances from portals to facilities cannot be directly enumerated since each client may not be assigned to its closest open facility. To overcome the difficulties caused by the fairness constraints, we construct an auxiliary graph and use minimum weighted perfect matching to get the cost between the portals of each block and the ones in its children. In order to satisfy the fairness constraints, we bound the fairness constraints of each open facility in the leaves of the split-tree based on the relation between the subproblem and the subproblems of its children. To obtain the assignment of the given instance and remove the fairness violation, we construct a new b-value min-cost max-flow model based on the set of open facilities. For the fair k-median problem in general metrics, we present a polynomial-time approximation algorithm with ratio O(log⁡k). Our approximation algorithm for the fair k-median problem in doubling metrics is the first result for the corresponding problem without any fairness violation in doubling metrics.}

More precisely, these parameters define the maximum over- and minimum under-representation of any group in any cluster.· Our clustering algorithm works on any ℓp-norm objective (e.g. k-means, k-median, and k-center). Indeed, our algorithm transforms any vanilla clustering solution into a fair one incurring only a slight loss in quality.· Our algorithm also allows individuals to lie in multiple protected groups. In other words, we do not need the protected groups to partition the data and we can maintain fairness across different groups simultaneously.Our experiments show that on established data sets, our algorithm performs much better in practice than what our theoretical results suggest.},

    abstract = { We present a novel approximation algorithm for \$k\$-median that achieves an approximation guarantee of \$1+\sqrt{3}+\epsilon\$, improving upon the decade-old ratio of \$3+\epsilon\$. Our improved approximation ratio is achieved by exploiting the power of pseudo-approximation. More specifically, our approach is based on two components, each of which, we believe, is of independent interest. First, we show that in order to give an \$\alpha\$-approximation algorithm for \$k\$-median, it is sufficient to give a pseudo-approximation algorithm that finds an \$\alpha\$-approximate solution by opening \$k+O(1)\$ facilities. This is a rather surprising result as there exist instances for which opening \$k+1\$ facilities may lead to a significantly smaller cost than that of opening only \$k\$ facilities. Second, we give such a pseudo-approximation algorithm with \$\alpha=1+\sqrt{3}+\epsilon\$. Prior to our work, it was not even known whether opening \$k+o(k)\$ facilities would help improve the approximation ratio. }
